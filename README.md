# Revit-API-ViewFiltersFactory

## Description

Revit API IExternalApplication plugin executable via PushButton in the Revit Ribbon Tab Panel "BH Plugins".
The application carries out the following tasks:
* Creates set of View Filters in the Revit Active View each one named after a different frame family type name.
* Assigns to each View Filter a different colour based on a selected colour palette
* Assigns all the frame instances to the corresponding View Filter based on the corresponding family type name.

The automated creation of such View Filters allow to display quickly and visually the differences between the types of frame section assigned to the elements visible in the view.
